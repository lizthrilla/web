              Jason is a native Floridian who started building for the web as a
              teen in the mid-’90s, so he’s been a web developer for about as
              long as anybody. Co-founding the Tampa Ruby Brigade in 2006,
              Suncoast Developers Guild in 2015, Jason takes pride in being a
              leader in the local tech community. After stints in academia,
              startups, and as a consulting freelancer, he’s found great joy in
              mentoring and sharing the knowledge gained along the way. He’s
              also a game development enthusiast, passionate about
              cryptocurrency, and loves animation. Jason is a father, a skeptic,
              entirely too opinionated, and prefers a word count in powers of
              two. When the world gets heavy you can find him either unbuilding
              LEGO® sets as catharsis or harnessing his power animal—the panda.
