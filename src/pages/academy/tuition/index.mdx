### Program Tuition

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
Tuition for the Immersive and Night Shift programs is a flat fee of **$14,900** for the entire program. The tuition does not include any costs associated with parking, meals, or any other fees not specifically provided for in this catalog or the enrollment agreement. The tuition does not include any costs that may be required for, or associated with, the purchase of a laptop computer.

### Payment

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
After being accepted in to the program, you can reserve a seat in our course with a deposit of $1,000. The entire amount of the deposit will be applied to your tuition balance, and the remaining funds will be due before the first day of class unless alternative financing arrangements are made. Payment can be made by check, money order, debit, or credit card.
