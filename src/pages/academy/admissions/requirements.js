        <h3>Hardware Requirements</h3>

        <p>
          A laptop computer is required for our program. Minimum requirements:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>8GB of RAM</li>
          <li>250GB HDD or SSD</li>
          <li>
            macOS Mojave (10.14) <em>or</em> Windows 10 64-bit (with WSL
            <sup className="footnote">
              <a href="#wsl">1</a>
            </sup>
            )
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The suggested computer for students is an Apple MacBook Pro laptop
          less than two years old. Why do we prefer Macs? All of our students
          being on the same platform enables us to move at a much quicker pace.
          Processes like setting up new tools experience reduced friction
          because the same workflows apply to everyone.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally, The open source and web development communities are
          invested in tools and libraries that work best with POSIX based
          operating systems like UNIX, Linux, and Appleâ€™s macOS (BSD Unix). In
          short, we believe using the macOS best prepares our students to work
          in the web development industry.
        </p>

        <p>
          Students who choose to study .NET development with us may also find
          substantial benefit from using macOS. PC laptops are approved for
          class use on a case by case basis during the interview process.
