**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: July 20, 2020**

Suncoast Developers Guild (SDG) is excited to announce its inaugural **Suncoast Developers Conference** to be held virtually on Saturday, August 1, 2020.

The Suncoast Developers Conference is a free community event that put together to help local Tampa Bay developers highlight and share their knowledge with others. The event will be broadcast over [Twitch](https://sdg.codes/twitch), and community members can join in additional conversations using SDG’s [Discord](https://sdg.codes/discord).

In addition to keynote speakers showcasing local software developer talent and discussing topics of interest to developers throughout Tampa Bay, our own experienced developers at SDG will also be presenting some of the Academy’s recent graduates and their final projects to introduce them to the tech community as they start their new careers. This introduction gives our local junior developers a chance to showcase their abilities and feel welcomed into the community.
