**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: April 6, 2020**

## SDG Announces Hero Award Scholarship

**St. Petersburg, Florida**&ndash; Suncoast Developers Guild (SDG) is proud to announce its **Hero Award**, a scholarship fund that
supports our veterans, active-duty military, first responders, law enforcement, and teachers
in their efforts to transition into a new software development career. The award also extends
to the spouses, partners, parents, and children of our heroes.

### A &ldquo;Hometown Hero&rdquo; Scholarship

&ldquo;Putting the Hero Award into place has been a dream of ours for over a year. We’re now able
to put the team into place to support the expansion of our program and recognize the
contributions of our local heroes. The Hero Award program complements our existing Diversity
Scholarship. We’re fully committed to developing a tech workforce that celebrates and reflects
our diverse community,&rdquo; said Jason L Perry, CEO of Suncoast Guild. 

Suncoast Developers Guild has also sought to narrow the gaps in our industry by introducing
local companies to diverse talent. SDG currently offers a Diversity Scholarship of $1,900 to
members of communities that are underrepresented in technology. This opportunity is available,
but not limited to: self-identifying women, people of color, individuals with disabilities,
and the LGBTQ community. Members of all underrepresented groups may apply for this scholarship.

### Reimagining Workforce Development 

SDG prepares individuals for entry-level jobs as junior front-end or back-end web developers.
Graduates will be able to find employment with companies who build and maintain their own
websites and web applications (i.e. product work), or with agencies that produce websites and
web applications for other companies (i.e. client work). SDG has excellent student placement
rates with most graduates employed within 3 - 6 months of graduation. Students learn client-side
(front-end) technology: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as server-side (back-end) technology
such as .NET, Node.js, or Ruby on Rails. At the end of the course, students will be able to
create beautiful, fully functional websites backed by databases and server-side applications. 

SDG’s core values of Universal Ability, Transformative Skills, and a Supportive Community
permeate through its programming and operations. For example, SDG students join its extensive
developer community of 2,000+ and benefit from networking, personal growth, and mutual support.
