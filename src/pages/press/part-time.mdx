# St. Pete’s Coding School Offers Part-Time Classes

**St. Petersburg, Florida**&ndash; For those looking to change careers, the challenge of training for a new industry can be daunting. But St. Pete’s Suncoast Developers Guild(SDG) is making it easier for people to learn new skills while juggling a busy schedule. Beginning the second week of March, the school will offer part-time classes to teach students everything from web development to digital marketing.

Thirty percent of workers cite boredom as the primary reason for wanting to leave their jobs; twenty-five percent are leaving in search of higher pay. A career in technology could be the solution as an ever-evolving, high-paying field. Suncoast Developers Guild is ready to prepare job-seekers for that transition.

“We have people who want to learn something new, but their schedules just don’t allow them to invest much time in it,” says SDG president Toni Warren. “We want them to know we’ve been listening. These part-time courses are in direct response to the need for classes that work with people’s demanding schedules.”

The school says classes are not only for those looking to change career paths, but also for current programmers who are looking to upskill in specific areas. Courses include “Web Development Test Drive”, “User Experience (UX) for Non-Designers”, “Digital Marketing”, and “Building Interactive Websites”.

The school has emerged as the leading center for tech education after the closing of The Iron Yard in 2017. As Florida’s only non-profit immersive code school, Suncoast Developers Guild is providing the technical and soft skills often necessary to pursue rewarding careers as programmers. It also aims to promote community among local technology organizations.
Classes begin March 11 and last for six weeks. Some courses are Saturday-only attendance; others will be conducted on two recurring weekday evenings. For more information about courses and registration, visit Suncoast.io.
